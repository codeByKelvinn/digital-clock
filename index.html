<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This is how we delcare the document type -->

 <!-- tell the browser what verison of html we are using. Currently using HTML5 -->
<html lang="en">
    <!--this HTML tag tells the browser everything between the html opening and closing angular brackets will be in HTML code -->
   
<head>
    <!-- charset means character set -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!--meta dada = associated data -->
    <!--UTF 8 is the standard in codinng if using HTML5... this incluses all international symbols, avoids MOJIBAKE(spellcheck LOL) -->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <!-- IE = INERNET EXPLORER -->
    <!-- the X-UA-COMPATIBLE tag allows web authors to choose what version of INTERNET explorer the page should be rendered as -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <!-- width=device-width sets the webpages width to the width of the device screen. initial-scale=1.0 sets the initial zoom level of the webpage when it's loaded. Without this meta tag you would notice everything on a mobile would be very small and squeezed to fit the content to look the same as it does on a monitor -->

    <!-- the meta tags tell the browser how it should render or diaplay the page and also give information to search engines about contents of the website -->
